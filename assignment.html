    <h1><b> My assignment.html page for linking to assignment items for your Website Assesment</b></h1>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will use to find your elements.  Do not name this page anything other than assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and mark your assignment elements.<span>&nbsp; </span>How to use this page:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Please, link this page to your website's index.html page</li>
        <li>over time, link each assignment task listed below to its location in your website as soon as you have started it</li>
        <li>
            replace the "notes" paragraph with your notes or
            delete if you have no notes - your notes will help us understand and
            mark your site so you should explain things. Maybe you did a task
            differently from the way we specified it, either because your way is
            better (tell us) or minimally or not at all to fit in with your site's
            look and feel (tell us) or ... (also tell us). So, for example, a video
            might spoil the look and feel. What you do is make one anyway, link to
            it from this assessment.html page and explain in the <i>Notes</i> why
            it's not linked to from your public version of your web site. You can
            style this page as your like, so long as you keep the links to the
            assignment tasks.
        </li>
        <li>provide link to report where indicated</li>
        <li>delete these instructions when you are ready</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br></p>
    <h1><b>Website Topic</b></h1>
    <p>
        Journey through the world with food.<br />
        Cooking is one of my many interests; I believe I am a decent chef and enjoy devouring food. Everyone aspires to travel across the world, but many of us are unable to do so owing to financial difficulties. My approach of exploring other cultures and regions around the world is through the various cuisines. This website attempts to demonstrate the differences in culinary methods, food variations, and simple recipes that can be used as inspiration.
        <br />
        I intend to exhibit the world map, show common cuisines from many regions, and provide some facts about the specialities. I will also provide links to YouTube videos and recipes for people like me to follow.
    </p>

    <p><br></p>
    <h1><b>Website Release 1.0</b></h1>
    <h2><b>1.1 Introduce Your Topic/Passion</b></h2>
    <p><a href="aboutme.html">Me and My passion!</a></p>
    <p>In this element I have mentioned who I am and why I decided the topic of the website. It's a small insight into a part that makes me whole.</p>
    <h2><b>1.2 CSS</b></h2>
    <p><a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7731298/css/style.css">Main CSS</a>:: this is the main CSS page,it holds common CSS for all html files i.e. header,footer,nav bar, some common section styling as well </p>
    <p><a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7731298/css/aboutmestyle.css">About me page CSS</a>:: this has styling for the table used in about me and the img styling(width,height and hover)</p>
    <p><a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7731298/css/feedbackstyle.css">Feedback page</a>:: this has styling for the feedback form, the inputs and button</p>

    <p><a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7731298/css/sourcelogstyle.css">SourceLog page CSS</a>:: this has sourcelog table styling</p>
    <p>The above design has been followed keeping in mind that this is the first draft/release of the website and multiple changes will be done to them in the future.It supports ease of extension</p>

    <h2><b>1.3 Site Map</b></h2>
    <p><a href="sitemap.html">Site Map</a></p>
    <p>This is a basic sitemap with multiple places still underconstruction, since the elements are underconstruction, the link to them is not clickable yet</p>
    <h2><b>1.4 Source Log</b></h2>
    <p><a href="sourcelog.html">Source log</a></p>
    <p>I have created a tabular format for the references, most places I have used w3schools for how to on designing the html and the css,hence the references of those are clubbed together unless anything is used specifically.</p>
    <p>this link is given in the footer of the webpage</p>
    <h2><b>1.5 Feedback Form</b></h2>
    <p><a href="feedback.html">Feedback</a></p>

    <p><a href="theworld.html#cta-two">CTA in body </a></p>
    <p>
        CTA one is asking the user to provide feedback, CTA two is asking using to click on glowing red dots on map.<br />
        Both CTA's not only have strong wordings but are also glowing to attract user attention.
    </p>

        <b> <i>Please note:: </i></b> <br />
        I have used the Iframe Library on the recipes.html webpage to embed youtube videos, this is not meant for assignment 2 rather for assignment 3, I just wanted to get done with that part early
        <br />
        Use google chrome, microsoft edge or safari for best viewing experience

    <h2><b>3.1 Reflections</b></h2>
    <p><a href="aboutmysite.html">Reflections</a></p>
    <p>I have tried to make my point of view and journey clear through this small but tedious essay, it's just my sense of humour, kindly don't fault my code for it</p>

        For best effect check on Microsoft edge <br />
        Here I have made multiple changes in the CSS of the webpage on print<br />
        1. The background turns into white, that is the background of the site, this is to make it more printer friendly<br />
        2. I have changed the way the gallery looks on print, when you try and print it, the images will be visible with caption unlike on the webpage<br />
        3. The menu bar is also removed from the print<br />
        4. When you try to print the world website, you will not see the header CTA in the print<br />
        5. The layout of the print is similar to keep the look cohesive while removing a few unnecessary components which might not be useful for user<br />
        6. On sitemap, it changes to a list format, this is done so that the sitemap list items don't get cut off in portrait mode.
        <br >
        While testing this, I would suggest you do a few print settings, make sure your print takes into consideration background elements as well
        The main changes I have made are as follows: I have added printstyle with media = print in every webpage of the website. This is a common css file to show and hide certain components of the page.
        In some of the CSS files, I have made changes to the CSS by adding a @media print component which will only work when you are trying to print the website
        I have also made a few changes to the javascript to have a look at to incorporate the CSS changes for gallery.<br />

        <b>Please note</b> most of the changes done for this CSS is make it more printerfriendly, I did not want to change a lot of the look and feel of the page or the user will not be able to get what they wanted when they try to print.
        <br />
        This is a link of what the print of index.html should look with background graphics included:<a href="css/img/print_css/index_print_background.pdf">With background graphics</a><br />
        This is a link of what the print of index.html should look without background graphics included:<a href="css/img/print_css/index_print.pdf">Without background graphics</a><br />
        This is a link of what the print of theworld.html should look without background graphics included:<a href="css/img/print_css/world_print_background.pdf">Without background graphics</a><br />
        This is a link of what the print of theworld.html should look without background graphics included:<a href="css/img/print_css/world_print.pdf">Without background graphics</a><br />
        This is a link of what the print of sitemap.html should look with background graphics included:<a href="css/img/print_css/sitemap_print.pdf">With background graphics</a><br />
        All other webpage prints look similar in terms of nav bar and footer

    </p>
    <h2><b>3.3 Social Networking Button(s) or Feed(s)</b></h2>
    <p>
        Here there is a feed added and posts added, no specific buttons as there is an OR mentioned in the requirements
        I have embeded instagram posts here:<br />
        <a href="posts.html">Instagram Posts</a><br />
        I have embeded the videos using curator.io here:<br />
        <a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7731298/recipies.html?itemid=india">India recipies</a><br />
        <a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7731298/recipies.html?itemid=usa">USA</a><br />
        <a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7731298/recipies.html?itemid=canada">Canada</a><br />
        If you would like a link to the feed, it is available in the sourcelog<br />
        The rest of the countries in recipe.io I have embeded the videos using IFrame with code directly from the official youtube page.<br />
        I recognise that this causes issues in my website being coherent but I did not have an option as I am using a free curator.io account and I can only create 3 feeds, I thus improvised.<br />

    </p>
    <p>
        If you need to look at the embedding code, kindly follow the link to the particular page, for the IFrame code, you can have a look at <a href="recipies.html">recipies.html</a>, please use this link only to check the code and not as a part of the website, since there is no proper itemid mentioned in the url, it will take you to a basic common website page with no details. I have just added this in for your reference, I do not know how you will be checking this part.<br />
        If you would like another way to check the youtube embed code, you can go to the website world page, click on any red dot that is not in one of the countries mentioned above.
    </p>
    <h2><b>3.4 Website Accesibility</b></h2>
    <p>
        All components in the website are accessible using the keyboard
        The most work I have put in is to make sure that the images in the gallery and red dots on the map are also accessible using the tab key
        Changes I made for that are available in:<br />
        <a href="java/galleryscript.js">Java Script for gallery</a><br />
        <a href="index.html">Gallery on home page</a><br />
        <a href="theworld.html">world page for map svg</a><br />
        <a href="java/worldscript.js">Java Script for world</a><br />
        <br />
        <b>Please note </b>that all a tags do not have aria-label, this is done consiously as it is good standard practice to not use aria-label if it's contents are the same as a, it should be only used when there is no content/text between the opening and closing 'a' tags.
        <br> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53769927/is-an-aria-label-needed-for-basic-all-link-tags">Reference for the explaination</a>
        <br > To be extremely clear, I have added the attribute to the nav bar and footer in every website, this was a decision made before I found out what the best practice is, I have left it that way so that in case the navbar doesn't load properly on small screen, the arialabel will help.'
    </p>
    <p>
        You can simply reach every link in the webpage/website in by using tab key
        <br >
        Now in the gallery:<br />
        you can navigate through the images using up/down arrow keys or tab key.<br />
        You can open and close an image using enter alternately close it using ESC key
        <br >
        Now in the world map:<br />
        you can navigate between the red dots using tab key<br />
        use enter key to go to that particular recipe page.
    </p>
    <h2><b>3.5 Website Validation</b></h2>
    <p><a href="validation.html">Validation</a></p>
    <p>
        I would like to note that there are multiple errors on my various webpages, but the reasons for those errors are required. For instance I keep getting an error of the lang tag, but when I add it, the page does not load properly.
        In places I have had to remove the Doctype attribute because the CSS does not load properly, some of my h2 tags are empty because it gets populated via javascript when something is clicked on etc.    
    </p>
    <h2><b>3.6 Something Original</b></h2>
    <p>
        <a href="testimonials.html">testimonials</a> <br />
        <a href="java/testimonial.js">script</a><br />
        <a href="css/testimonials.css">css</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        If I when I plan to release this site, I would like to have a database to keep track of all testimonials uploaded by users.
        For now I have uploaded a few testimonials of my friends regarding my cooking and the website. In the future, I would allow my users to upload their own testimonials through the website on their own.
        I have also added a section where the users of the page can leave their comments that get auto updated on the website in realtime. I am using google documents for that, any user can leave comments, for the sake of this assignment
        I am only allowing only the first 500 comments to be visible on the page, you cannot submit the form without filling in the details. <br>
        Because of the limitations of using googlecloud and google sheets, everytime a user leaves a comment I get a notification. This can be solved by using php or someother database and integrating it with node.js
        <br />
        For now though, you can use this gmail account to get control of the google sheet that stores the data.<br />
        account: testwebsitetestwebsite72@gmail.com<br />
        password: testwebsite_1997<br />
        It is a really great method for datastorage if I do not want to invest in a separate database.<br />
        You can have a look at the data stored here <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17gIeC87on3aKgRdFSblxU-o-s4faPJm_LNSNVuHXY5E/edit?usp=sharing">google sheet</a>
                                                    <br />
        if you have a question of how this page is different from feedback, I will explain, this is purely for thoughts about me or what do you feel, I am not asking the user for feedback, this is for user interaction, they can leave comments and communicate with other users<br />
        Basically it's a simplified messaging column that the users can use.<br />
        I would suggest you use GoogleChrome browser for this part.
